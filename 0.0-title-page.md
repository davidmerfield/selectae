## Remarks

- The accent on the uppercase 'E' in the title is interesting – I thought that uppercase characters typically lacked diacritical marks in French
- The title ends with a period
- There is what looks like a previous owner's inscription at the top of the title page. What does it say?
- How many fonts are used to print the page? I guess somewhere around 6 different fonts are combined.
